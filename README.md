## Overview

this is another solution to the problem on Frontend Mentor.

My other solution: [Using Flexbox](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/single-price-grid-component-desktopfirst-html-and-scss-d4q23ybYC)

### The challenge

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

Started out with HTML then went the desktop-first route. After that, started modifying things to fix the problems. when it's in the mobile screen query, i just change the font size this time. looks like it works just fine.

### Built with
